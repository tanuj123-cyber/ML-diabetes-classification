# ML-diabetes-classification

Out of the classification models listed below, we aimed to evaluate which is the best predictor of diabetes after being trained on a dataset of public health information gathered by the CDC.

1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machines
3. Single Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. Adaboost

To evaluate this, we plot the ROC curve, print the classification report, and find the ROC AUC score for each model prediction. We eventually find that the Adaboost model was the best predictor, with an AUROC score of approximately 0.83.

A python file is provided, however it is recommended to view the code in a Jupyter Notebook for optimal readability.
